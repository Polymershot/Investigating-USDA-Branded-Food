# Investigating-USDA-Branded-Food-Tier-List-Included-

To see a summary of the project, please view the summary directory. Regarding the source and transformations of the data, please view the sql_scripts and data directories. 

## Things I learned:
1. Handling many tables and the best way to join/clean them in Python and SQL
2. How to connect SQL and Jupyter Notebook
3. Making a basic Streamlit App to let people see the data/graphs without having to open the file themselves
4. How to work with applying scalers to different categories of data (think about grouping)

## Remarks
Further improvements I would make would be to use a better scoring model and look into patters/trends for certain food categories. It is important to note that I didn't take into account ingredients. The numbers will and can lie!
